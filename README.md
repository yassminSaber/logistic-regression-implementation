# CHD predictor using logistic-regression

## about the dataset 

-The "Framingham" heart disease dataset includes over 4,240 records,16 columns and 15 attributes. The goal of the dataset is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future (CHD) coronary heart disease.

## Logistic Regression from scratch 

- what is logistic regression ?
Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification problems, where the outcome variable is categorical and has two classes (e.g., 0 or 1, True or False). It is commonly employed in machine learning and statistics to model the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class.
The logistic regression model uses the logistic function (also known as the sigmoid function) to transform a linear combination of input features into a value between 0 and 1. The logistic function is defined as:

σ(z)= 1 / 1 + exp(-z)

where z is the linear combination of input features and model parameters:
z = β0 + β1​ x1+ β2 x2 +…+ βn xn
